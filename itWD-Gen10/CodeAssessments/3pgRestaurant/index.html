        <p id="desc">
                We love to eat. With friends, family, and the occasional co-worker after a long day its good to kick back and enjoy all-american flavours we've known since kids.
                A restaurant full of nostalgia, with experienced chefs and the goal to create a connection between eachother. Queeen's Eatery is more than a local watering hole.
                We understand environmental impact, and make sure we only source from sustainable, locally owned farms and butchers.
